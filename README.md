# Desktop Pet
A desktop pet is basically a moving window displaying images/GIFs with user interactive functions (custom behaviors in response to mouse, keyboard events etc.)

This work is initiated for personal exploration and practice.
### Things to try out:
 - Containerization -  extend to other OS
 - RESTful - make an API to handle route pattern
 - host on web to allow customization of program executable based on gifs

## Content

1. Source code in Python
i.e. pet.py
2. .bat file for running [pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/) and its builds
